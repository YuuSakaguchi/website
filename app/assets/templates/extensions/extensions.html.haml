  %h1 Extensions for Standard Notes

  %p Extensions allow you to plug 3rd party services into your Standard Notes experience.

  %p Anyone can build their own extension. You install an extension via a unique URL that you receive from your extension provider.

  %h1 About Extensions
  %p
    Because our focus is to make your data survive for as long as possible, we had to design our system differently.
    We aim to keep a separation of concerns between your data and our notes app. Your data is owned by you, not us, on your Standard File account.
    Standard File is not an entity, nor is it a product — it's a way of structuring and encrypting data that anyone can use and build on. Standard Notes on the other hand <em>is</em>
    an entity. However, our system is designed such that your data does not depend on us to survive.

  %p Both Standard Notes and Standard File have their own extensions.

  %p
    %strong Standard Notes extensions
    are related to how you interact with the Standard Notes app. These are primarly extensions that you can <em>see</em>. The main types of extensions here are menu-based and custom editors.
  %p
    %strong Standard File extensions
    are related to your data, and where it is backed up or stored. These are extensions that operate behind the scenes, without you needing to think about them. These include things like 3rd-party sync, or managing revision history for your data.

  %p Standard Notes extensions are registered using the main application, while Standard File extensions are registered using your Standard File dashboard, which you can access through the "Account" panel in the Standard Notes app.
